# Scalability Strategy

## Current System Scale

The Meme Coin Aggregator is currently designed to handle:

- Hundreds of concurrent API requests
- Dozens of WebSocket connections
- Tracking hundreds of tokens
- Periodic updates every 30 seconds

## Scaling Challenges

As the system grows, several challenges need to be addressed:

1. **Increasing Data Volume**: More tokens to track and more data points per token
2. **Growing User Base**: More concurrent connections and requests
3. **Real-time Requirements**: Maintaining low latency for price updates
4. **External API Limitations**: Rate limits on third-party data sources

## Horizontal Scaling Approaches

### API Service Scaling

The FastAPI application can be horizontally scaled by:

1. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   - Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer (Nginx, HAProxy)
   - Configure health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic
   - Implement sticky sessions for certain request patterns if needed

2. **Stateless API Design**:
   - The API endpoints in `app/api/routes/tokens.py` are designed to be stateless
   - State is maintained in Redis and the database, not in application memory
   - This allows any instance to handle any request

3. **Auto-scaling Configuration**:
   - Set up auto-scaling based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or request rate
   - Implement gradual scaling policies to avoid sudden changes
   - Configure minimum and maximum instance counts

### WebSocket Scaling

WebSocket connections are stateful, requiring special consideration:

1. **Distributed Connection Management**:
   - Enhance `app/services/websocket.py` to use Redis for connection tracking
   - Implement a shared state model where connection metadata is stored in Redis
   - Each instance handles its own connections but can broadcast to all

2. **Redis Pub/Sub for Cross-Instance Communication**:
   - Add Redis pub/sub functionality to broadcast updates across instances
   - When one instance receives data updates, it publishes to Redis
   - All instances subscribe to these messages and relay to their connections

3. **Connection Balancing**:
   - Implement a connection limit per instance
   - Configure load balancer to direct new connections to instances with capacity
   - Implement graceful handling of connection limits

### Database Scaling

PostgreSQL can be scaled to handle increased load:

1. **Read Replicas**:
   - Modify `app/core/database.py` to support read/write splitting
   - Direct read queries to replicas, write operations to the primary
   - Implement query routing based on operation type

2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Optimize async_session configuration for efficient connection usage
   - Configure maximum connection limits appropriate for instance size
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms when connection pool is saturated

3. **Database Sharding (Future)**:
   - For extreme scale, implement token data sharding by token groups
   - Modify data access code to query the appropriate shard
   - Consider a federated query layer for cross-shard operations

### Caching Layer Scaling

Redis caching can be enhanced for scale:

1. **Redis Cluster**:
   - Upgrade `app/core/cache.py` to support Redis cluster configuration
   - Implement consistent hashing for key distribution
   - Configure proper slot allocation for efficient key distribution

2. **Hierarchical Caching**:
   - Add an in-memory cache layer for ultra-hot data
   - Implement a TTL strategy that cascades from memory to Redis
   - Use memory caching for active WebSocket subscription data

3. **Cache Warming and Preloading**:
   - Implement background jobs to pre-warm caches for popular tokens
   - Add predictive loading based on trending tokens
   - Ensure cache keys are designed for efficient invalidation

## Vertical Scaling Considerations

While horizontal scaling is the primary approach, vertical scaling can help:

1. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Increase instance memory for larger in-memory caches
   - Optimize memory usage in the application code
   - Configure garbage collection for Python to reduce pauses

2. **CPU Scaling**:
   - Select instance types with more cores for parallel processing
   - Optimize CPU-intensive operations like data merging in `app/services/aggregation.py`
   - Consider CPU usage when designing background tasks

3. **I/O Optimization**:
   - Use high-performance storage for database instances
   - Optimize network configuration for minimal latency
   - Consider local caching for reducing network I/O

## External API Scaling Strategies

Managing external API dependencies at scale:

1. **Enhanced Retry Mechanisms**:
   - Refine the retry logic in `app/utils/retry.py` for smart backoff
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Add jitter to retry intervals to prevent thundering herd problems

2. **Rate Limit Management**:
   - Implement token bucket rate limiting for external APIs
   - Share rate limit counters across instances using Redis
   - Add adaptive rate limiting based on response patterns

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Implement graceful degradation when external APIs are unavailable
   - Create synthetic data providers for temporarily missing data
   - Cache previous responses with appropriate staleness indicators

## Monitoring and Metrics for Scaling

To effectively scale, implement comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Key Metrics Collection**:
   - Track request rates, response times, and error rates
   - Monitor WebSocket connection counts and message throughput
   - Measure cache hit/miss ratios and database query performance

2. **Auto-scaling Triggers**:
   - Define scaling policies based on collected metrics
   - Set appropriate thresholds with hysteresis to prevent oscillation
   - Configure alerts for unexpected scaling events

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Add tracing to identify bottlenecks in the request path
   - Implement periodic load testing to validate scaling configurations
   - Use profiling to identify optimization opportunities

## Implementation Plan

A phased approach to scaling the system:

1. **Phase 1: Monitoring and Optimization**
   - Implement comprehensive metrics collection
   - Optimize existing code for performance
   - Enhance caching strategy

2. **Phase 2: Basic Horizontal Scaling**
   - Configure load balancer for API services
   - Implement Redis pub/sub for WebSocket coordination
   - Set up database read replicas

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Scaling Features**
   - Implement auto-scaling based on metrics
   - Add hierarchical caching
   - Enhance external API resilience

4. **Phase 4: Geographic Distribution**
   - Deploy to multiple regions for lower latency
   - Implement data synchronization across regions
   - Configure global load balancing

## Cost Considerations

Balancing performance with operational costs:

1. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Right-size instances based on actual load
   - Implement scheduled scaling for predictable traffic patterns
   - Consider spot instances for non-critical components

2. **Caching Efficiency**:
   - Optimize TTL values to balance freshness and hit rates
   - Use compressed data formats to reduce memory usage
   - Implement selective caching based on data importance

3. **Database Operations**:
   - Optimize query patterns to reduce database load
   - Consider read-heavy vs. write-heavy optimization strategies
   - Implement appropriate indexing and query planning
